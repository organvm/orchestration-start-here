# Outbound Contribution Engine — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** APPROVED
**Location:** `orchestration-start-here/contrib_engine/`

---

## 1. What This Is

An automated public-facing engine that scans for high-signal open-source projects, ranks them by symbiotic potential with ORGANVM, initializes cross-organ contribution workspaces, monitors active PRs, and triggers distribution when work ships. This is the automation layer that makes the public-facing contribution process self-initiating rather than session-prompted.

---

## 2. Architecture

Three modules in a single package (`contrib_engine/`), consuming from the application pipeline and producing contribution workspaces in ORGAN-IV:

```
application-pipeline/signals/  ──→  Scanner  ──→  ranked_targets.yaml
                                                        │
                                                        ▼
                                                  Orchestrator  ──→  contrib--{project}/
                                                                          │
                                                                          ▼
                                                                     Monitor  ──→  ORGAN-VII
```

### Module 1: Scanner (`contrib_engine/scanner.py`)

**Inputs:**
- `application-pipeline/signals/contacts.yaml` — inbound leads with org/channel
- `application-pipeline/signals/network.yaml` — network graph nodes
- `application-pipeline/signals/outreach-log.yaml` — prior interactions
- GitHub API — repos that starred `4444J99/*`, open issues on target repos

**Outputs:**
- `orchestration-start-here/contrib_engine/data/ranked_targets.yaml` — scored targets

**Scoring criteria:**
- Inbound signal strength (they reached out = highest)
- Domain overlap with ORGANVM capabilities (multi-agent, governance, testing, CI/CD, versioning)
- Repo health (stars, active issues, contribution guidelines exist, recent commits)
- Relationship capital potential (YC-backed, hiring, team size)
- Issue match quality (open issues where ORGANVM patterns apply)

**Capability map** (what ORGANVM can contribute):
- Promotion state machines / lifecycle governance
- Multi-agent orchestration patterns
- Testing infrastructure (pytest, CI/CD)
- Design versioning / reproducibility
- Dependency validation / graph governance
- MCP server integration
- Documentation governance
- Security patterns

### Module 2: Orchestrator (`contrib_engine/orchestrator.py`)

**Inputs:**
- `ranked_targets.yaml` — from Scanner
- Human approval (CLI: `organvm contrib approve <target>`)

**Actions on approval:**
1. Fork target repo to `4444J99/{repo}`
2. Create `contrib--{project}/` directory in ORGAN-IV superproject
3. Initialize git repo with README, CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTION-PROMPT.md, seed.yaml
4. Create GitHub remote at `organvm-iv-taxis/contrib--{project}`
5. Add as submodule in superproject
6. Register in `registry-v2.json`
7. Create journal directory with session-00 entry
8. Generate CONTRIBUTION-PROMPT.md from target repo's CONTRIBUTING.md + ORGANVM capability map
9. Update IRF with new OSS items

**CLI:**
```bash
organvm contrib scan                    # Run scanner, update ranked_targets.yaml
organvm contrib list                    # Show ranked targets
organvm contrib approve <target>        # Initialize workspace for target
organvm contrib status                  # Show all active contributions
```

### Module 3: Monitor (`contrib_engine/monitor.py`)

**Inputs:**
- All `contrib--*/` directories in ORGAN-IV superproject
- GitHub API — PR state, reviews, comments, CI checks

**Actions:**
- Poll active PRs every cycle (designed for cron/LaunchAgent)
- Detect state changes: new comments, review requests, CI failures, merges, closures
- On new review comment: create journal entry, flag for human response
- On CI failure: diagnose and create fix plan
- On merge: update journal, promote seed.yaml LOCAL→CANDIDATE, trigger ORGAN-VII distribution
- On close/reject: journal the outcome, archive the workspace

**Output:**
- `contrib_engine/data/contribution_status.yaml` — current state of all contributions
- Journal entries in each `contrib--*/journal/`
- Notifications (stdout for now, LaunchAgent integration later)

**CLI:**
```bash
organvm contrib monitor                 # Run one monitoring cycle
organvm contrib monitor --watch         # Continuous monitoring (for LaunchAgent)
```

## 3. Data Schemas

### ranked_targets.yaml

## 5. Integration Points

- **Application pipeline:** Read-only consumer of `signals/` YAML files
- **Superproject:** Orchestrator creates submodules, pushes to remotes
- **Registry:** Orchestrator adds entries via Python (same pattern as Hive registration)
- **IRF:** Orchestrator and Monitor update IRF completions
- **ORGAN-VII:** Monitor triggers distribution on PR merge (future: Kerygma profile creation)
- **LaunchAgent:** Monitor designed for periodic execution via `com.[user].contrib-monitor.plist`

---

## 6. Constraints

- GitHub API via `gh` CLI (subprocess), not octokit — consistent with workspace policy
- All YAML I/O via PyYAML with safe_load/safe_dump
- No external dependencies beyond stdlib + pydantic + pyyaml
- Scanner runs offline-capable (cached GitHub data) with online enrichment
- Human approval required before any workspace creation (no autonomous forking)
- Monitor never pushes code — only journals and flags
