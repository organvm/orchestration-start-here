#### 2. GoDaddy — MET4VERS.IO Domain Renewal

| **Source** | GoDaddy Renewals (customer #49384738) |
| **Domain** | MET4VERS.IO — expired 2026-03-29 |
| **Issue** | Payment method on file failed. .IO domains have short redemption grace periods. |

| **Handler** | **HUMAN** — GoDaddy account |
| **Scope** | Billing action only. No system impact regardless of outcome. |

### P1 — Dev Action This Week

#### 4. a2a-python PR #915 — Split and Resubmit

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | act-S48-0401-010 |
| **Priority** | P1 (urgency: 0.6) |
| **Source** | Ivan Shymko (ishymko), a2aproject maintainer |
| **Feedback** | Export of `TenantTransportDecorator` declined ("implementation detail, not exported by design"). Invited to factor out other fixes for merge. |
| **PR decomposition** | |

**Changes to DROP** (1 file):
- `src/a2a/client/transports/__init__.py` — both hunks add the export. Entire file change rejected.

**Changes to KEEP** (2 files → new PR):
- `src/a2a/client/transports/tenant_decorator.py` — one-line docstring fix: `send_message()` said "streaming" when it's non-streaming (copy-paste error from `send_message_streaming()`)
- `tests/client/transports/test_tenant_decorator.py` — two new test methods: `test_close_delegates_to_base`, `test_async_context_manager`. Brings module coverage from 97.87% → 100%. Tests import from private path (no export needed).

**Follow-up PR spec:**
- **Title:** `fix(client): correct TenantTransportDecorator.send_message docstring and add lifecycle tests`
- **Branch:** Fresh from `1.0-dev` (do not reuse existing branch)
- **Body:** Reference #915 for provenance, acknowledge maintainer guidance on export decision
- **After merge:** Close #915

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Handler** | **AGENT SESSION** — contrib engine PR cycle |
| **Scope** | Create branch, cherry-pick 2 of 3 file changes, open new PR, close #915 |
| **Contrib engine tracking** | a2aproject/a2a-python, Wave 4 |

#### 5. Chime Card Statement

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | — (informational) |
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Action** | Review March statement in Chime app |
| **Handler** | **HUMAN** — Chime mobile app |
| **Scope** | Read-only review |

## Handoff Prompts

### Agent Session: a2a-python PR Split

```
CONTEXT: PR #915 on a2aproject/a2a-python was partially declined.
Maintainer says TenantTransportDecorator export is "not exported by design."
They invited factoring out the docstring fix + tests.

TASK:
1. Clone/fetch a2aproject/a2a-python, checkout 1.0-dev
2. Create branch: fix/tenant-decorator-docstring-and-tests
3. Apply ONLY these changes:
   - src/a2a/client/transports/tenant_decorator.py: fix send_message() docstring
     (change "streaming" to "non-streaming")
   - tests/client/transports/test_tenant_decorator.py: add test_close_delegates_to_base
     and test_async_context_manager
4. Do NOT touch src/a2a/client/transports/__init__.py
5. Open PR titled: "fix(client): correct TenantTransportDecorator.send_message
   docstring and add lifecycle tests"
6. Reference #915 in body. Acknowledge maintainer guidance.
7. After new PR opens, close #915 with comment noting the split.

PR COMMENT DISCIPLINE: One commit. No pre-review bumps. Silence after addressing feedback.
```
