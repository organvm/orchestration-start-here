## 4. NODE STRUCTURE

### Definitive 13-Node Structure (from doc 2b)

**PHASE 1 — ELEVATE (Physical Sovereignty)**

| # | Node | Truth | Key Sources |

| 2 | **Your Body Is the Starting Point** | You don't think your way into alignment — you regulate into it. | `health/Body Trust and Shifts`, `health/Fascia and emotions` (fascia→chakra mapping), `health/Hormones & Healing.docx` (full ebook, ready) |
| 3 | **Stabilize Your Blood Sugar** | You can't heal in a chemically unstable body. | `health/Hydration and blood sugar` ("Square Zero" = hydration + nutrition), `health/Gut Rebuilding Diet Plan`, `mindset/Meal Planning and Budgeting Help` (ready) |

| 5 | **Sleep Is Non-Negotiable** | Exhaustion distorts reality. | `health/Period related rest plans` (ready), `health/Hormone Cycle Guide` |

**PHASE 2 — ALIGN: Awareness (Inner Sovereignty)**

| # | Node | Truth | Key Sources |
|---|------|-------|-------------|
| 6 | **Awareness Creates Choice** | You can't change what you don't see. | `mindset/Blindspots Gaps and Cons`, `mindset/Overwhelm to Clarity`, `concepts/Dopamine vs Oxytocin Energy` (ready, yin/yang checklist) |

| 8 | **Patterns Run Until Seen** | What's unconscious will keep repeating. | `mindset/Neuro-signatures and Pruning`, `mindset/Romanticized Reality of Change`, `mindset/Success and small habits`, `concepts/Book Concept Breakdown` (Compound Effect distilled, ready) |
| 9 | **Your Reality Is Interpreted** | You're not reacting to life — you're reacting to meaning. | `mindset/Emotional misattunement`, `mindset/Shift Your Mindset` (ready) |

**PHASE 4 — UNLOCK (Financial Sovereignty / Expansion)**

| # | Node | Truth | Key Sources |
|---|------|-------|-------------|
| 13 | **Systems Create Freedom** | Alignment without structure won't last. | `business/Financial Freedom Blueprint` (ready, 12-step path), `business/Idea Implementation Strategies` (ready), `business/Novel Funnel Strategies`, `business/Sales momentum plan` |

### Node Count Divergence

The HTML prototypes use **14 nodes** (original spiral) that don't match the **13-node** 2b structure:

| HTML Node | Maps to 2b Node | Resolution |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
| 1. Feel Good First | → 1. Feel Good First | Direct |
| 2. Nervous System Regulation | → 4. Your Nervous System Is the Filter | Reordered |
| 3. Check-In: Where Am I? | No direct equivalent | Absorbed into multiple nodes |
| 4. Radical Responsibility | → 10. Radical Responsibility (with Love) | Reordered |
| 5. Yin & Yang Balance | Cross-cutting (appears in 5, 6, 12) | Distributed |
| 6. Maslow's Physical Needs | → 3. Stabilize Your Blood Sugar (broadened) | Merged |
| 7. Mind-Gut Connection | Absorbed into 2, 3 | Merged |
| 8. Compound Echo | → 8. Patterns Run Until Seen | Reframed |
| 9. Root-Level Healing | Absorbed into 2, 3 | Merged |
| 10. Self-Worth Shift | → 11. You Can't Change What You Won't Acknowledge | Reframed |
| 11. Aligned Action | → 13. Systems Create Freedom | Merged |
| 12. Quantum Creation | No direct equivalent in 2b | Dropped or future |
| 13. Embodiment | Cross-cutting | Distributed |
| 14. Rebirth | No direct equivalent in 2b | Dropped or future |

**Decision required:** Lock the 13-node 2b structure (recommended — Maddie's most recent and considered architecture) or revert to the 14-node HTML structure. Maddie's margin notes in 2b suggest she was actively consolidating.

| "94% of disease caused/worsened by stress" | health/Cortisol carousel | **Unverified.** No peer-reviewed source. |
| Water stores "vibrational information" / EZ water as H3O2 | health/Cellular Reprogramming | **Not supported.** Water memory repeatedly debunked. |
| Talking to cells triggers fat cell differentiation inhibition | health/Cellular Reprogramming | **Extreme overstatement.** Mechanotransduction real; this application is not. |
| DNA as "biophotonic emitter" optimized by speech | health/Cellular Reprogramming | **Speculative fringe.** |
| CymaScope: 15-20% improved RBC viability from music | health/Cymascope | **Unverified.** Self-published, not replicated. |
| Sound frequencies improve cancer prognosis | health/Cymascope | **Not supported** by mainstream oncology. |
| Neurodivergent ATP/metabolic waste → autoimmune | health/Neurodivergence-autoimmune | **Speculative.** No citation. |
| "87% of U.S. beef imported from Saudi Arabia" | health/Milk source | **Debunked within the file itself.** |
| Sulphur baths cause "holes on feet" from parasite die-off | health/Sulphur benefits | **Not supported.** Likely maceration. |
| Collagen has piezoelectric properties → chakra energy | health/Fascia and emotions | **Partially supported.** Piezoelectric = real. Chakra extrapolation = speculative. |
| Endometriosis "doubled in last ten years" | health/Endometriosis | **Unverified.** Likely diagnosis increase. |
| Spoon bending through intention | time-astro/Spoon bending | **Fringe.** |
| Hunched back indicates past-life trauma | concepts/Hunched Back | **Fringe.** No evidence base. |

**Recommendation:** Flag for Maddie before publishing. Three tiers:
1. **Remove or reframe:** Water memory, cell-talking, biophotonics, spoon bending, past lives
2. **Add caveats:** Cymatics healing, stress-disease %, endometriosis doubling
3. **Keep (accurate with nuance):** Fascia piezoelectricity, Alzheimer's report, crying-cortisol

## 9. CROSS-FOLDER STRUCTURAL PATTERNS

1. **Water Hub = Spiral sub-system.** The `water/Water hub design` file explicitly mirrors the Spiral's branch structure with quiz-based routing. Business/ contains the sales mechanics to activate it. These two folders are one system split into product and distribution.

2. **Yin/Yang is the throughline.** Appears in every folder: business (80/20, alignment rituals), water (science + story), time-astro (moon/hormone cycles), concepts (dopamine/oxytocin), mindset (6+ files). Node 5 operates across every domain.

3. **Nervous system regulation gates everything.** Every folder returns to the same premise: the nervous system must feel safe before anything else works. Node 4 is the prerequisite, not just a node.

4. **The healing IS the content pipeline.** ~50% of files are simultaneously personal therapeutic processing AND social media content development. The wound work produces the reels. This is structurally important — the product generates itself.

5. **Three standalone product candidates:** (a) Hormones & Healing ebook, (b) Inner child book concept, (c) Astrology/hormone planner. Each exists independently of the Spiral and could ship separately.

6. **4 empty files, 1 duplicate, 1 utility** can be pruned from the inventory.
