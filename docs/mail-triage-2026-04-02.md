## Formal Sort

### P0 — Human Action Required Today

#### 1. SWARMs Hackathon — Inbound from GitHub Profile

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P0 (strategic decision) |
| **Source** | Thomas King, Canteen community ([email redacted]) |
| **Subject** | Virtual invite-only hackathon: "Solana With Autonomous Running Machines" |
| **Dates** | April 6 – May 11, 2026 |
| **Overlap** | Agent swarm concepts (debate primitives, KV cache as agent memory, multi-agent coordination) align with `agentic-titan` topology patterns |
| **Divergence** | Solana/crypto focus is orthogonal to current ORGANVM priorities |
| **Criticality** | **LOW** system impact (zero workspace references). **HIGH** signal value — inbound from GitHub profile = proof the 113-repo presence attracts attention |
| **Action** | Decide: participate (time investment ~Apr 6 – May 11), decline, or archive for later |
| **Handler** | **HUMAN** — strategic decision on participation vs. current priorities |
| **Scope** | Decision only. If yes, requires Luma registration with passphrase. |

#### 2. Tammer Galal — LinkedIn Direct Message

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P0 (respond today — LinkedIn messages decay quickly) |
| **Source** | Tammer Galal, Senior Technical Curriculum Developer at Datadog |
| **Channel** | LinkedIn DM (content not visible in email digest) |
| **Criticality** | **MEDIUM** — Datadog is high-value (observability/infrastructure). Could be recruitment, networking, or curriculum collaboration |
| **Action** | Read the actual LinkedIn message and respond |
| **Handler** | **HUMAN** — LinkedIn mobile/web |
| **Scope** | Read and reply. Assess intent before committing. |

#### 3. GoDaddy — AMPLABMEDIA.COM Final Cancellation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P0 (billing — "final cancellation notice") |
| **Source** | GoDaddy Renewals (customer #49384738) |
| **Domain** | AMPLABMEDIA.COM — expired 2026-03-13 |
| **Issue** | Payment method failed. Final notice before permanent deletion. |
| **Criticality** | **HIGH** — AMPLABMEDIA.COM is the **Object Lessons** brand (film video essay series). Has a Kerygma distribution profile (`organvm-vii-kerygma/kerygma-profiles/profiles/amp-lab-media.yaml`), YouTube channel (`@AmpLabMedia`), and knowledge base entries in ORGAN-I. This is a **live creative asset** in the ORGANVM system, NOT a parked domain. |
| **Prior context** | MET4VERS.IO (flagged April 1) is genuinely parked/unreferenced. AMPLABMEDIA.COM is categorically different — losing this domain means losing the brand's web identity. |
| **Action** | **RENEW IMMEDIATELY.** Update payment method → manually renew. MET4VERS.IO is a separate decision (low criticality). |
| **Handler** | **HUMAN** — GoDaddy account |
| **Scope** | Billing action only. |
