### DORMANT ORGANS

| Organ | Repos | Last substantive work |
|-------|-------|-----------------------|
| **ORGAN-II (Poiesis)** | 8 checked | **Zero real commits since Mar 25** — entire organ dormant |
| ORGAN-V (Logos) | 3 repos | Edge wiring only (AX-6), no content work |
| ORGAN-VI (Koinonia) | 5 repos | community-hub had edge wiring, rest dormant |
| ORGAN-VII (Kerygma) | 4 repos | announcement-templates had registry fix, rest dormant |

**Concentration pattern:** Active work is concentrated in ORGAN-IV (3 repos), META (4 repos), PERSONAL (3 repos), ORGAN-III (4 repos). Organs II/V/VI/VII are structurally wired but operationally idle.

## II. Unclosed State

### Unclosed Sequences (7)

| Sequence | Session | Actions | Notes |
|----------|---------|---------|-------|
| seq-S42-001 | S42 | 173 | Chain composed, session closed, **boolean not flipped** — state inconsistency |
| seq-S38-001 | S38 | 54 | Orphaned |
| seq-S40-001 | S40 | 72 | Orphaned |
| seq-S41-001 | S41 | 18 | Orphaned |
| seq-S43-001 | S43 | 18 | Orphaned |
| seq-_sys-001 | _sys | 24 | System emissions (absorption, backflow) |
| seq-ROUTER-001 | ROUTER | 2 | Intake router bootstrap |

**Diagnosis:** The ledger emits `closed_session` and `composed_chain` actions but does not flip `closed: true` on the parent sequence record. This is a bug in `ledger.py` — the close path writes emission actions but skips the YAML boolean mutation on the sequence object.

### Hanging Prompts (137 across 72h window)

| Workspace | Count | Dominant themes |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| workspace-root | 43 | Gmail MCP/Docker setup, email filtering, 1Password friction, IRF expansion |
| meta-organvm | 42 | a-organvm restructuring, naming conventions, registry renaming, formalization |
| application-pipeline | 39 | Job logistics (URLs, LinkedIn, resumes), NLNet alignment, Gemini/Codex delegation |
| orchestration-start-here | 13 | Dense abstraction feedback, token conservation, agent relay, Spiral Path |

### Deferred (3)

All in `a-organvm` — low urgency, logged but not routed.

## III. Contribution Engine — Pending Actions

### Time-Sensitive (action required now)

### Backflow Not Deposited (14 items)

| Target Organ | Count | Types |
|--------------|-------|-------|
| ORGAN-I (theory) | 3 | Effective-k formula, structural/functional connectivity, graph diameter validation |
| ORGAN-II (generative) | 1 | Convergence experiment as interactive visualization |

| ORGAN-IV (code) | 4 | Changie pattern, declarative policy, JSON Schema normalization, client parity |
| ORGAN-V (narrative) | 4 | Comprehension debt essay, naming essay, SHOULD/MUST framing, reciprocity essay |

All 14 have empty `artifact_path` — none written to destination directories.

## IV. Registry & Governance Drift

### Seed.yaml Promotion Staleness (5 repos)

| Repo | seed.yaml says | Registry says | Drift since |
|------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| agentic-titan | PUBLIC_PROCESS | GRADUATED | 2026-02-11 |
| agent--claude-smith | CANDIDATE | GRADUATED | 2026-02-24 |
| a-i--skills | CANDIDATE | GRADUATED | 2026-02-24 |
| petasum-super-petasum | CANDIDATE | GRADUATED | 2026-02-12 |
| universal-node-network | CANDIDATE | GRADUATED | 2026-02-11 |

### Repos Missing seed.yaml (6 in ORGAN-IV)

`agentkit`, `contrib--coinbase-agentkit`, `contrib--dapr-dapr`, `contrib--notion-mcp-server`, `research`, `tools`

### LOCAL Repos (14 of 128)

7 are ORGAN-IV contrib forks (expected). 7 organic repos may warrant promotion planning:
- vigiles-aeternae--corpus-mythicum (I)
- vigiles-aeternae--theatrum-mundi (II)
- content-engine--asset-amplifier (III) — actively developed
- sovereign-systems--elevate-align (III) — actively developed
- styx-behavioral-commerce (III, PROTOTYPE)
- cvrsvs-honorvm (META, PROTOTYPE)
- vigiles-aeternae--agon-cosmogonicum (META)

### Edge Gaps

27 non-LOCAL repos have empty `dependencies` in repo-registry.json, including 7 flagships.

---

## V. Infrastructure Gaps

### CI Coverage

| Organ | Repos with CI | Repos without | Gap severity |
|-------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| ORGAN-IV | 6/6 | 0 | Clean |
| META-ORGANVM | 1/14 (.github dispatch only) | 13 | **Critical** — includes organvm-engine |
| ORGAN-I through VII | Not audited | — | Unknown |

**Critical:** organvm-engine (shared Python engine imported system-wide) has zero CI. No tests, no lint, no secret scanning in any META repo.

### LaunchAgent Failures (3)

| Agent | Exit code | Severity |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| `com.[user].mcp.servers` | 78 | **High** — powers tool infrastructure |
| `com.[user].pipeline.daily-monitor` | 1 | Medium — contribution monitoring |
| `com.[user].pipeline.daily-scan` | 1 | Medium — contribution scanning |

### LaunchAgents Documented but Missing (8)

`desktop-router`, `downloads-tidy`, `naming-maintenance`, `agents-policy-sync`, `home-root-guard`, `domus.daemon`, `domus.sort`, `chezmoi.self-heal` — likely gated by `domus_auto_enabled = false` in chezmoi config.

### Test Coverage Gaps

| Area | Tested | Untested |
|------|--------|----------|
| contrib_engine/ | 12 modules | — |
| action_ledger/ | 5/6 modules | cli.py |
| intake_router/ | 2/2 modules | — |
| scripts/ | 3/14 | **11 scripts** including reconcile-72h.py, validate-all-seeds.py |

### Code Debt Markers

Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX in scanned Python files. Debt lives in structural form (unclosed sequences, undeposited backflow) rather than inline markers.

## VI. IRF Critical Items

### P0 (human-action required)

| ID | Item | Owner | Urgency |
|----|------|-------|---------|
| IRF-INST-001 | NLnet NGI0 Commons Fund application | Human | **Deadline: 2026-04-01 12:00 CEST** |
| IRF-INST-015 | Human review pass on NLnet draft | Human | Blocks INST-001 |
| IRF-INST-016 | Register ORCID | Human | 5 minutes |

| IRF-SYS-011 | GoDaddy domains PARKED — billing | Human | Revenue risk |
| IRF-SYS-012 | Vercel deployment cascade (18+ failures) | Agent | Blocks all deploys |
| IRF-DOM-002 | Add domus to repo-registry.json | Agent | Keystone — unblocks 3 items |

### P1 Structural (154 total, key items)

## VII. Vacuum Taxonomy

Vacuums classified by type and urgency:

### A. Structural Vacuums (system coherence)

1. **Sequence close bug** — `ledger.py` does not flip `closed: true` on sequences. 7 sequences perpetually unclosed.
2. **Seed.yaml drift** — 5 ORGAN-IV repos show wrong promotion_status. Registry and local state diverged ~6 weeks ago.
3. **14 backflow items undeposited** — knowledge extracted from contributions never reached target organs.
4. **27 repos missing dependency edges** — graph is structurally incomplete.

### B. Operational Vacuums (work blocked or stalled)

1. **3 LaunchAgents failing** — MCP servers (exit 78) is highest priority.
2. **3 contribution actions overdue** — temporal bump, hive decision, langgraph community join.
3. **137 hanging prompts** — 43 in workspace-root (Gmail/Docker/1Password friction dominate).
4. **NLnet deadline today** — IRF-INST-001.

### C. Coverage Vacuums (missing instrumentation)

1. **META-ORGANVM zero CI** — 14 repos including the shared engine.
2. **11 untested scripts** in orchestration-start-here.
3. **ORGAN-II entirely dormant** — no substantive work in 7+ days.
4. **Organs V/VI/VII** — wired but not producing.

### D. Governance Vacuums (rules not enforced)

1. **tool-interaction-design** — flagship GRADUATED repo with no CI (violates implied graduation contract).
2. **6 ORGAN-IV repos missing seed.yaml** — not tracked by governance system.
3. **Seed.yaml coverage** — 72/117 system-wide (target: 117/117).
